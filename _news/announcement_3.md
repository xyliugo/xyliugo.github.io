ðŸ¤“ Our paper [NoisyRollout](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13055) is on Arxiv now! We propose a simple yet effective data augmentation technique that enhances visual reasoning in VLMs by mixing rollouts from clean and moderately distorted images during RL training â€” no extra cost, just smarter exploration.
