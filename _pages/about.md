Hello! I'm Xiangyan, a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at National University of Singapore, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Michael Qizhe Shieh](https://michaelshieh.com/). My research centers on multimodal and agentic foundation models, with an interest in solutions that are simple, generalizable, and scalable.

Prior to my PhD, I gained valuable industry experience through internships at Shanghai AI Lab and Alibaba Tongyi. I also had the invaluable opportunity to work with Prof. [Tao Lin](https://tlin-taolin.github.io/) at Westlake University, whose mentorship deeply inspired me and shaped my path to research. Recently, I'm fortunate to be working closely with Dr. [Tianyu Pang](https://p2333.github.io/), Dr. [Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io/) and Dr. [Longxu Dou](https://longxudou.github.io/) at Sea AI Lab.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my research or would like to discuss potential collaborations. You can find my contact information at the bottom of this page.
